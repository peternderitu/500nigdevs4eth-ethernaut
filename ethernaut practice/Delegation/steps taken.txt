1. using delegatecall you can call a target contract functions using a caller contract without changing context i.e msg.sender, msg.value or storage.
2. contract Delegation calls contract Delegate which has function pwn() which chnges ownership when invoked.
3. so if owner in Delegate occupies slot 0, we make msg.sender be saved in 0
4. await sendTransaction({from:player, to:instance, data: web3.sha3("pwn()").slice(0,10)})
5. This calls the function name and argument data types, first 4 bytes
